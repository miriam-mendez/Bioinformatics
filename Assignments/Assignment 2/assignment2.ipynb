    "Exercise 1 and exercise 2 have been solved in a very similar way. Moreover, both used the same input strucutre to build the metabolic network (CSV file).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of exercise 1 was identify the **non essential** enzymes, while exercise2 focuses on finding the **essential** enzymes. Both tasks run the BFS algorithm to determine the shortest path, utilizing the given input metabolites and biological endpoint. In exercise 3, the objective shifts to identify enzymes that are suitable to remove in order to kill the cancerous cells. For that task I implement the Dijkstra algorithmn in order to find the healthiest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Exercise 1, identifying redundant enzymes involves extracting enzymes that the BFS has not traversed, i.e., those not visited during the algorithm's execution. To achieve this, we subtract the enzymes visited by the BFS from the enzymes in the given metabolic network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Exercise 2, the goal is to display the enzymes obtained during the BFS execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In exercise 3, identifying enzymes suitable for removal to eliminate cancerous cells, involved find a path where the enzymes are the most healty one. To achieve this, the Dijkstra algorithm was employed, utilizing health ratios as weights to find the healthiest and essential path. Enzymes not traversed by Dijkstra were deemed redundant and targeted for removal if were affected for cancerous cells. Those ones are the enzymes  output in the exercise."
